## 🔐 Key Features
- User Authentication – Secure login/signup with JWT-based authentication.
- Live Stock Data – Real-time updates from Finnhub API for accurate portfolio tracking.
- Portfolio & Transaction Dashboard – View your owned stocks, transaction history, and market prices with clean summaries.
- AI-Powered Stock Price Prediction – LSTM neural network model forecasts future prices based on historical data from Alpha Vantage API.
- Interactive UI/UX – Smooth animations and responsive design with React and Framer Motion.
